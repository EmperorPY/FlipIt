# INITIAL APPLICATION SETUP & WINDOW CONFIGURATION
# =====================================================================

# Initialize the main CustomTkinter application window context
root = ctk.CTk()

# Set the window title that displays in the OS top title bar
root.title("FlipIt")

# Set the window dimensions (550px width, 700px height) and lock its 
# initial boot position to the absolute top-left corner of the screen (+0+0)
root.geometry("550x700+0+0")  

# Grid Column Configure: Give columns 0 through 5 an equal layout "weight" of 1.
# This forces CustomTkinter to distribute window width completely evenly 
# across all 6 horizontal columns, allowing the cards to stretch cleanly.
root.grid_columnconfigure((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), weight=1)

# Grid Row Configure: Give rows 0 through 6 an equal layout "weight" of 1.
# This distributes window height perfectly across all 7 vertical rows.
# Row 0 handles the game Title. Rows 1 to 6 handle the 32 card slots.
root.grid_rowconfigure((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), weight=1)


# =====================================================================
# UI TITLE COMPONENT
# =====================================================================

# Create the visual header label with large italicized and bold styling
title = ctk.CTkLabel(root, text="FlipIt", font=("Helvetica", 40, "italic", "bold"))

# Place the title securely in Row 0. 
# 'columnspan=6' stretches the label spanning across all 6 columns so it centers perfectly.
# 'pady=15' adds spacing above/below, and 'sticky="nsew"' expands it to fill its slot.
